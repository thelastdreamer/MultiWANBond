## 📝 Notes

### Architecture Decisions Made

1. **Cross-Platform Detector Pattern**
   - Created `UniversalDetector` wrapper
   - Platform-specific implementations via build tags
   - Allows for platform-optimized code while maintaining common interface

2. **Caching Strategy**
   - 5-second cache for interface detection
   - Reduces system calls for frequently-accessed data
   - Can be cleared manually when needed

3. **Monitoring Approach**
   - Linux: Real-time via netlink subscriptions (efficient)
   - Windows/macOS: Polling-based (5-second interval, less efficient but works)

4. **Custom Display Names**
   - `SystemName` (read-only, e.g., "eth0")
   - `DisplayName` (user-configurable, e.g., "Office Fiber Primary")
   - Maintains separation between system and user-facing names

### Design Patterns Used

- **Strategy Pattern** - Platform-specific detector implementations
- **Factory Pattern** - `NewDetector()` selects platform implementation
- **Observer Pattern** - Interface change monitoring
- **Cache-Aside Pattern** - Interface info caching
