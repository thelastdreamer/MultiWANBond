## Bugs Found and Fixed During Testing

### Bug #1: FlowKey Invalid Map Key Type
**File:** `pkg/router/router.go`, `pkg/protocol/types.go`
**Severity:** Critical (compilation error)
**Root Cause:** FlowKey contained `net.IP` (slice type) which cannot be used as map key
**Fix Applied:**
- Added `String()` method to FlowKey for string conversion
- Changed router's flowMap from `map[FlowKey]uint8` to `map[string]uint8`
- Updated 4 locations in router.go to use `flowKey.String()`

### Bug #2: Unused Variable in Health Checker
**File:** `pkg/health/checker.go`
**Severity:** Minor (compilation warning)
**Root Cause:** Created `probe` variable but never used it
**Fix Applied:**
- Removed unused variable declaration
- Added TODO comment for future implementation

### Bug #3: String Multiplication Syntax Error
**File:** `cmd/server/main.go`
**Severity:** Minor (compilation error)
**Root Cause:** Used Python-style `"=" * 80` which Go doesn't support
**Fix Applied:**
- Changed to `strings.Repeat("=", 80)`
- Added "strings" import

### Bug #4: VLAN Name Generation
**File:** `pkg/network/vlan/types.go`
**Severity:** Medium (incorrect output)
**Root Cause:** Used `string(rune(vlanID))` which converts int to character
**Fix Applied:**
- Changed to `fmt.Sprintf("%s.%d", parent, vlanID)`
- Now correctly generates names like "eth0.100"
